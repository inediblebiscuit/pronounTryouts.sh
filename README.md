# pronounTryouts.sh
Shell script that generates name and pronoun messages with user inputs.

## basic instructions:
1. download the file "pronounTryouts.sh"
2. get the file path of the file
3. open terminal and write "bash (insert file path)"
4. enjoy your name and pronoun messages~

tbh you shouldn't trust sketchy downloads like this, but it's readable even from the drive link I provided above. so you can see that it's a simple text-based script only. all the best and enjoy!

## some features I've included:
- supports he, she, they, custom pronouns, and name only messages.
- allows editing of name and pronouns without closing the program

## upcoming features:
- making a webpage that does this
- fixing janky parts of some 'they' messages
- fixing lack of capitalisation on some messages with variables
- adding more messages
- pronoun randomisation feature: use multiple sets of pronouns at once
