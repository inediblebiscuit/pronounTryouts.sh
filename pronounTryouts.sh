Our mom says she's so happy to have another $child now. I think you'll really like $name, $sub1 a really cool guy." 

        # "$name is just in the other room changing. No, I don‚Äôt think $sub forgot to bring the paintings. So the other day during the heist, I saw $obj slip the paintings into that bag of $pop. I know $name brought it into the car, and Zoe told me $sub saw the same bag in $pod car. Why don‚Äôt we go ask $name if $subHave the paintings to be sure? Well, why don‚Äôt you trust $name, I trust $obj. I doubt $sub would ever keep that painting for $ref, $name just isn‚Äôt that kind of person. Oh, hi $name, we were just talking about the paintings from Thursday. Nat here was wondering if you had them in your car. Wonderful! See Nat, we can trust $obj. Now go and get those bloody painting so we can meet the fence." 

        "Huh? What did $name just say? Can you repeat what $sub said?‚Äô" 

        "$name is finally free to hang out today, so $sub‚Äôll be joining us at lunchtime."

        "$name and I have a lot of classes together. I‚Äôve heard $sub also likes chemistry and $sub‚Äôs in my friend‚Äôs chem class. apparently $sub‚Äôs a gamer, i wonder what $sub plays and if we have any in common." 

        "Yeah, I'm going over to $name's house tomorrow, 'cause $sub said $sub would help me with the math homework. $name is pretty good at math, y'know? And then I want to meet $pod pet cat. I think later this week $sub'll come over to meet my dog." 

        "Have you met $name yet? $sub1 in my chemistry class. Me and $name sat next to each other one time and talked about birds until the teacher told us to be quiet. I find $pod name very interesting." 

        "$name hasn‚Äôt showed up yet, did $sub get lost or something? It‚Äôs $pod first time coming here, so let‚Äôs wait for $obj a while longer. 
        Oh, there $subIs. Hello! " 

        "$name is free this afternoon if you want to talk to $obj. You can ask $obj about it now. " 

        "Hey $name, let‚Äôs have lunch together today, it‚Äôs been a while since we caught up. $name, do you prefer pizzahut or domino‚Äôs?" 

        "$name left $pod water bottle behind today, I‚Äôll get it for $obj since I‚Äôm going back anyway. $sub can get it back tomorrow when we meet again." 

        "Oh, I‚Äôve heard of $name, I think I‚Äôve met $obj once before. $sub seems like a pleasant person, but I don‚Äôt really know $obj. If you want to know $obj, why don‚Äôt you just talk to $obj?" 

        "I don‚Äôt know if $name prefers cheese sauce or ketchup, let‚Äôs just get both for $obj. If $sub doesn‚Äôt want it, then I‚Äôll just take the sauce." 

        "$name forgot $pod wallet today, do you have some spare cash to lend $obj? When you‚Äôve finished your part on the document, send it to $name, $sub can take care of the rest." 

        # "Did you hear about what $name did last week? $sub went hiking up the nearby mountains and carried a keyboard up with $obj. Like, wow, $sub carried an electric keyboard on $pod back like 8 kilometres up the face of a cliff, camped near the top, and spent the whole bloody next day playing the Tetris theme to the wind and clouds. I just hope that the keyboard is actually $pop, that thing looks pretty banged up from being carried that far." 

        "Hey, it's $name! $sub1 so cute and smart! $name is real good with computers too, $sub helped me out recently. I hope I'll be meeting $obj again soon, I love to hang out with $obj!" 

        # "Oh, did you hear about $name‚Äôs newest creation? $sub made a beautiful painting of a campground that $pod family took $obj to back when $sub was a child. $name is sooo talented, I wish I was $obj."

We shook hands this morning and they are soooo soft. Like baby soft. I really need to ask $name where $sub went. And what $sub did.Oh, hi $name, we were just talking about you. I hope you are having a wonderful New Years. We heard that you went to a place south last week and wanted to know what you had done to your hands?No no no, they‚Äôre just so soooooft. Like, how?" 

        # "Hey $name, $name is one of the cutest names ever, I just adored every $name I‚Äôve ever met. What I would say to you is go for it and try out, but also don‚Äôt feel rushed and pressured to figure it out now. I am assuming you are a teen, sorry if I'm wrong, but it‚Äôs ruff to figure who you are, I see some teens going as if wondering for a few months is a live or die in a rush kind a thing, but everyone has their own pace, take your time, not saying it has to wait for ever but just, take your time. I wish you all the luck and love üíï"

        "Have you seen $name? $sub2 got a new haircut, and it suits $obj really well! I wonder if $sub cut it themself, or if $sub go to a hairdresser. I should ask $obj when I see $obj again!" 

        "A couple of days ago, I met $name. I got to talk to $obj for a bit and $sub seemed really cool! $sub suggested we go to the cinema together this weekend. Do you maybe want to join us and say hi to them? I'm sure $name would be happy to introduce $ref to you!" 

        "$name and I were supposed to meet up here, but $sub seem to be running late. I've thought about calling them, but maybe $sub1 just stuck in traffic. $sub mentioned the roads tend to be quite busy during this time of the day. I'm sure $sub will be here soon. Oh, wait, I think that's $obj over there! Hi $name!" 

        "Have you seen $name? I borrowed a book from $obj earlier and want to return it to them, but I can't seem to find $obj anywhere! If you see $name, can you let $obj know I'm looking for them?"
